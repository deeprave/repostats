# Repository Statistics Tool

A modern, fast git repository analysis tool.

## Overview

repostats is a local-first repository analysis tool that provides detailed insights into code repositories through a modular, plugin-based architecture. The tool emphasises performance, configurability, and extensibility while maintaining a clean separation of concerns through its highly organised module structure.
