//! Plugin Discovery System (Legacy - Removed)
//!
//! This file previously contained the legacy plugin discovery system which has been
//! replaced by the unified discovery system in unified_discovery.rs.
//!
//! The legacy system focused on trait-based discovery with PluginFactory enums,
//! while the new system uses struct-based discovery with PluginSource enums
//! to better support external cdylib plugin loading.

// This module is now empty - all functionality moved to unified_discovery.rs
